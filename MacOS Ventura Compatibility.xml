# This script was designed to be used as an Extension Attribute to ensure specific&#13;
# requirements have been met to deploy macOS Ventura.&#13;
#&#13;
# General Requirements:&#13;
#		- OS X 10.9.0 or later (It seems, as of the day I write this Apple has not yet made recommendations, this page and the script will be adapted if necessary when the information will become public)&#13;
#		- 4GB of memory (It seems, as of the day I write this Apple has not yet made recommendations, this page and the script will be adapted if necessary when the information will become public)&#13;
#		- 20GB of available storage (It seems, as of the day I write this Apple has not yet made recommendations, this page and the script will be adapted if necessary when the information will become public)&#13;
#&#13;
#&#13;
# These last 2 requirements can be modified in the first 2 variables (MINIMUMRAM&#13;
# and MINIMUMSPACE).&#13;
# 	- REQUIREDMINIMUMRAM: minimum RAM required, in GB&#13;
# 	- REQUIREDMINIMUMSPACE: minimum disk space available, in GB. Ventura has different&#13;
#							requirements depending on the OS from which you update&#13;
#							Adjust to your needs, lines 79 (Catalina) or 82 (pre-Catalina) &#13;
#&#13;
#&#13;
# Mac Hardware Requirements and equivalent as minimum Model Identifier&#13;
# 	- MacBook (2017 or newer), ie MacBook10,1&#13;
# 	- MacBook Pro (2017 or newer), ie MacBookPro14,1&#13;
# 	- MacBook Air (2018 or newer), ie MacBookAir8,1&#13;
# 	- Mac mini (2018 or newer), ie Macmini8,1&#13;
# 	- iMac (2017 or newer), ie iMac18,1&#13;
# 	- iMac Pro, ie iMacPro1,1&#13;
# 	- Mac Pro (2019 or newer), ie MacPro7,1&#13;
